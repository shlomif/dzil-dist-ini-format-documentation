=head1 DESCRIPTION

The L<Dist::Zilla>’s dist.ini file is read by L<Config::MVP>.

Each "normal" section loads the appropriate C<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::> plugin
(so, for example, C<[MetaJSON]> will load C<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MetaJSON>).

Within each such section, the C<key = value> pairs are passed as attributes
of the plugin. These attributes are hopefully documented in its documentation
and may have sensible defaults.

A section that starts with “C<@>” (= “at sign”) indicates a plugin bundle
which may load more than one plugin. So C< [@Basic] > will load the
C<Dist::Zilla::PluginBundle::Basic> bundle.

The special bundle C< [@Filter] > allows one to filter plugins from a bundle.

In addition to all that, there are some global, base-class, C<key = value>
pairs outside any section that are used by the L<Dist::Zilla> class as
documented there.
