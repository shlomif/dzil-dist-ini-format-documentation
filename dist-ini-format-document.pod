=head2 SYNOPSIS

    author = Bugs Bunny <bugs@bunny.tld>
    license = mit
    copyright_holder = Bugs Bunny

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The L<Dist::Zilla>â€™s dist.ini file is read by L<Config::MVP>.

Each "normal" section loads the appropriate C<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::> plugin
(so, for example, C<[MetaJSON]> will load C<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::MetaJSON>).

Within each such section, the C<name = value> pairs are passed as attributes
of the plugin. These attributes are hopefully documented in its documentation
and may have sensible defaults.
